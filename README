This package automates the building of standard OSF projects into installp
formated files.  On completion the installable fileset is placed in
${BASE}/installp/ppc.
As reference - The template created is stored in ${BASE}/buildaix/ while
temporary files are stored in ${BASE}/.buildaix/
Note: 'make clean' and make 'distclean' are not buildaix aware
and shall not remove these directories. You may remove .buildaix/ at any
time, but be cautious about ./buildaix - there may be additional customization.

SYNTAX buildaix
buildaix flags WITH options
-) add to configure arguments
P) define LPP, export lpp=${LPP} i.e., ipv lpp=$PRODUCT.$PACKAGE
F) define FSET
V) define VRMF, export vrmf=${VRMF}
D) copy proposal (need to copy/paste)
p) prefix
e) eprefix

buildaix flags WITHOUT options
h) help
f) force mode, -e Makefile && make -i distclean, rm -f Makefile config.*
E) eprefix=$prefix/${PRODUCT}/${FILESET}
U) define FORCE_UNSAFE_CONFIGURE=1
B) copy buildaix scripts for customization
T) copy template scripts for customization

* see man buildaix for more details

CONFIGURE and MAKE
If the default ./configure command in buildaix does not succeed
run ./configure manually until you have a successful configure run.
Then execute buildaix as the presence of a Makefile in the project root
will cause the script to skip calling configure

MAKE DESTDIR=${TEMPDIR} install
After make has completed, "make DESTDIR=${TEMPDIR} install" is called
to install the package in a scratch area rather than on the development
system.
If this fails, our recommendation is to use the GNU coreutils install
command. Adjust your PATH variable to be sure it is seen.

MKINSTALLP
The mkinstallp.ksh script works from the following assumptions:
NOTE: any files/directories in ${TEMPDIR}/usr/local are removed
my mkinstallp.ksh

These files are located in the USR part of the installp packaging

/etc is used for configuration - although /var/PROJECT/etc is preffered
/var is used for modifiable data

both /etc and /var are considered to be the ROOT part of the fileset

/opt, /var, /etc, /usr form the PKG.PROGRAM.rte (runtime environment) fileset
except /usr/share/man is put into a seperate fileset package
- aixtools.SOMETHING.man.en_US by default.

PATCHES that might be needed! (old versions of AIX!!)
I have had issues with assigning symbolic links in the packages - default mkinstallp
does not like these and exits with an error. Use following patch to "fix it"

Note: before applying the patch you may want/need to remove /usr/sbin/mkinstallp from
/etc/security/tsd/tsd.dat using
# trustchk -d /usr/sbin/mkinstallp

because the checksum will no longer be correct. I also needed to change the file mode
before applying the patch
# chmod u+w /usr/sbin/mkinstallp
